			<h2>Origins</h2>
			
			<h3>JOSEPH PILATES: FOUNDER</h3>
			
			<p>Developed in the 1920s by the physical trainer and founder Joseph Pilates, Pilates is an exercise system focused on improving flexibility and strength for the total body without building bulk.</p>
			
			<p>Pilates is a combination of stretching and strengthening exercises that emphasise body symmetry and abdominal control. Core exercises are designed to create an awareness of the deep torso muscles and to re-pattern any muscular-skeletal imbalances. All pilates movements are co-ordinated with breathing patterns and body alignment to provide maximum results. The exercises progress through a series of rhythmic, balanced motions designed to increase flexibility and strength.</p>
			
			<p>People of all ages and physical conditions can benefit from Pilates methods. It is an effective tool for injury prevention and rehab and is an excellent workout by itself or in combination with other forms of exercise.</p>
			
			<h2>Benefits</h2>
			
			<h3>BENEFITS OF THE PILATES METHOD</h3>
			
			<p>Pilates has wide applicability for those individuals who seek:</p>
			
			<ul class="pilates-list">
				<li>Longer, leaner muscles (less bulk, more freedom of movement).</li>
				<li>An improved posture.</li>
				<li>Increased core strength/stability and peripheral mobility.</li>
				<li>Greater resistance to injury.</li>
				<li>Balance between strength and flexibility.</li>
				<li>Heightened body awareness.</li>
				<li>Enhanced functional fitness and ease of movement.</li>
				<li>Improved performance in sport.</li>
				<li>Improved balance, co-ordination and circulation.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Pilates improves core strength and balances the muscles around the joints.  It specifically focuses on breathing, pelvic placement, rib-cage placement, scapular movement, knee tracking and correct neck placement.</p>
			
			<p>Pilates is a controlled approach to mind and body fitness and combines strengthening, stretching, breathing and controlled movements.  It is an effective and safe workout that is suitable for all ages, genders, and fitness levels.

			<p>STOTT PILATES is a contemporary approach to the original exercise method pioneered by Joseph Pilates.  Lindsay & Moira Merrithew, along with a team of physical therapists, sports medicine and fitness professionals, have spent over two decades refining the acclaimed STOTT PILATES mehtod of exercise and line of equipment.  The refined method resulted in the inclusion of modern principles of exercise science and rehabilitation - making it one of the safest and most effective methods available.</p>
			
			<p>STOTT PILATES incorporates modern exercise principles, and applies proven and accepted practices in biomechanics, rehabilitation and athletic performance enhancement.  After realising the benefits of the concepts of the original Pilates method, and in collaboration with a team of physical therapists/physiotherapists, sports medicine and exercise professions, the Merrithews dissected and reconnected this unique form of exercise into a comprehensive, systematic, contemporary approach to the original teachings.</p>
			
			<p>STOTT PILATES exercises are designed to restore the natural curves of the spine and rebalance the muscles around the joints.  This involves placing more emphasis on pelvic and scapular stabilisation, and integration of all the parts of the body into one.  As well, preparatory exercises and modifications allow the technique to be appropriate for many different body types and abilities, making it applicable to sport-specific training and every day life.</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h2 class="principles">The Five Basic Principles</h2>
			
			<p>The following five basic principles form the foundation of the method from which our education and all of our programming is developed.  Whether performed on a mat or on specialised equipment, application of the following biomechanical principles will ensure the realisation of maximum benefits from Pilates exercises:</p>
			
			<ul class="pilates-list">
				<li>Breathing</li>
				<li>Pelvic placement</li>
				<li>Rib cage placement</li>
				<li>Scapular movement</li>
				<li>Head & cervical spine placement</li>
			</ul>
