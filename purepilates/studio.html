			<h2 class="frequently">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			
			<h3>WHEN CAN I START PILATES?</h3>
			
			<p>I most cases, you will start Pilates at the start of a term.  Often due to high demand and to cater for late registrations, additional mat classes will be added to the existing term timetable.</p>
			
			<h3>DO I HAVE TO DO MATWORK BEFORE REFORMER?</h3>
			
			<p>No, but elements of matwork may be introduced into your reformer workouts if necessary, to assist you in understanding basic Pilates principles.</p>
			
			<h3>WHEN DO MAT TERMS RUN?</h3>
			
			<p>We run four mat terms per year, which run for 12 weeks each.  Depending on demand, we may start a shorter mat term for a group of people who can't wait for the next scheduled mat term to begin.</p>
			
			<h3>DO I NEED TO START WITH THE ESSENTIAL 1 PROGRAMME?</h3>
			
			<p>For those with little or no Pilates experience, you will start at the Essential 1 level.  Those with previous Pilates experience, will be assesed and placed in an appropriate class level.</p>
			
			<h3>WHAT DO I WEAR AND BRING?</h3>
			
			<p>Wear what is comfortable for you, but ensure your clothing allows you to move freely.  Footwear is not necessary.  It is recommended you bring a towel and water.</p>
			
			<h3>HOW LONG DO SESSIONS LAST?</h3>
			
			<p>All sessions, including reformer, last approx 55-60 minutes.  Enough time is left at the end of each session for instructor feedback and discussion.</p>
			
			<h3>CAN I DO PILATES WHEN I'M PREGNANT?</h3>
			
			<p>Yes, provided it is part of an ongoing Pilates programme you commenced prior to conception.  It is not advisable to start Pilates during your pregnancy, but your instructor will provide advice in this area.</p>
			
			<h3>WHAT IF I HAVE AN EXISTING INJURY OR CONDITION?</h3>
			
			<p>Existing conditions and injuries must be disclosed to your instructor prior to commencing Pilates.  Your instructor is also trained to ask you for these details.  In almost all cases, and often after discussion with your physician, a suitable and effective Pilates programme can be designed for you.</p>
			
			<h3>CAN I BRING ALONG A FRIEND TO PILATES?</h3>
			
			<p>You're welcome to bring a friend along to observe Pilates.  However, due to you being in a progression-based fitness regime, they will not be able to join in.</p>
