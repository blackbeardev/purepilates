				<h3>"I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY FOR FEMALES AND SOFTIES"</h3>
				
				<p>Being a builder ( and ex-rugby player ) with on-going lower back pain and re-occuring aches and pains, I needed to try something different because the continued visits to physio and the osteopath just weren't doing it.  I had heard a little about Pilates over the years, but like most males, I formed the attitude that it was simply for females and softies. How could it be of benefit and challenging for me. Well Bob and his team have certainly proved me wrong because it is.</p><br>
				
				<p>What's the saying? - "don't knock it 'til you've tried it" - it is so true. I'm just so pleased I gave it a go, I've never felt better, more flexible and fitter. Those constant aches and pains are a thing of the past. The only one not happy is my osteopath.</p><br>

				<h3>"A BIG FACTOR IN KEEPING ME OUT ON THE TRACK"</h3>
				<p>From struggling to survive an hour with Bob, to now feeling as though an hour isn't long enough, I can't imagine my training regime without Pure Pilates.</p><br>
				
				<p>The addition of Pilates into my training schedule has had incredible benefits for my career as an athlete.  Pilates has improved my efficiency of movement and has isolated and strengthened muscular deficiencies that had previously been undetected.  Bob's expertise has reprogrammed my muscle firing patterns to engage the correct muscles required to execute a movement.  This has been a huge asset in injury prevention.  Pilates provides the perfect balance between challenge and relaxation through the use of a variety of equipment.</p><br>

				<h3>"HE KNOWS US ALL SO WELL AND EXPERTLY GUIDES US"</h3>
				
				<p>I think the fact that I've been going to Pilates with Bob at Pure Pilates for nearly four years says it all! Apart from the fact that we have fun - it's great "therapy" - I love the effect it has had on my mobility and core strength, not to mention my body shape. Bob is professional and highly skilled. Every session is different and he is always looking for ways to introduce new elements and exercises.  He has a very "hands-on" approach and is careful to ensure that his clients understand and practise the Pilates principles correctly. He knows us all so well and expertly guides us, modifying exercises to accommodate our strengths and weaknesses and supporting us to push ourselves.  I can't actually imagine going anywhere else.</p><br>

				<h3>"I WISH I COULD GO EVERY DAY"</h3>
				<p>Before I started at Progressive Pilates, I had endless neck and back problems as well as regular headaches. Jill at Pure Pilates taught me how to correct my posture problems. After 6 months I no longer had regular appointments with my physio. I have now been doing Pilates for three years and the difference in my health is fantastic.</p>
				
				<p>A lot of people have noticed my improved posture and I really feel so much stronger and supple when performing my other sporting activities. Weight training in the past has always tended to bulk me up a little but I find Pilates makes my muscles just as strong but also longer and leaner. I look forward to my Pilates classes each week, and wish I could go every day.<p><br>

				<h3>"IMPROVING MY OVERALL FUNCTION USING PILATES ON A WEEKLY BASIS"</h3>
				
				<p>18 years ago I sustained a back injury and suffered ongoing back pain and muscle soreness. A friend of mine recommended that I go and see Jill at Pure Pilates to see if she could help me manage my back problem better. That was two years ago and I have never looked back. Jill has been able to improve my overall function using Pilates on a weekly basis. She has encouraged and supported me in a very professional friendly manner and I now remain active and look forward to my weekly session with her.</p><br>

				<h3>"WAY BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY"</h3>
				<p>Bob has been my Pilates instructor since a major traumatic accident four years ago.  Throughout my many operations, Bob and the team have helped me to regain strength and movement with a focus on my rehabilitation.  Their attention to detail and care has gone way beyond the call of duty and I wouldn't be where I am today without their dedication, care and support.  I cannot recommend them highly enough.</p><br>
